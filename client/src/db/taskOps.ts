 * cross-project Task Selection view both create/delete tasks in whichever
 * project the user picks, so they can't scope a `useProjectTasks(projectId)`
 * hook (that would mean instantiating one per task in a loop).
 * `spawnNextOccurrence`: shared by the two independent places a recurring
 * task can be marked complete (see its own doc comment). `toggleProjectTask`:
 * shared by every place a task's completion is flipped outside a scoped
 * `useProjectTasks` — same cross-project constraint as create/delete above.
 * `useProjectTasks` calls all four, so each rule (append-sortOrder,
 * soft-delete, spawn gating, completion flip) lives in exactly one place.

 *
 * Deliberately `max(timeBoxOrder) + 1`, NOT a count of active tasks: a count
 * collides as soon as it no longer equals one-past-the-max, which happens
 * two ways —
 *  (a) a task moves OUT of the box, leaving a gap (e.g. orders [0, 1, 2],
 *      the order-1 task moves elsewhere → [0, 2]; the active count is now 2,
 *      which lands a new append ON the existing order-2 task instead of
 *      after it), and
 *  (b) soft-deleted rows: the v10 migration stamps a `timeBoxOrder` on
 *      every row, deleted or not, so a box's count of *active* rows can sit
 *      below its true max the moment anything in it has ever been deleted.
 * `max + 1` over active rows only is immune to both, since it reads the
 * actual high-water mark instead of inferring it from a count.

 * Spawns the next occurrence of a completed recurring task, if one is due.

 * complete a recurring task: `useProjectTasks.toggleTask` (interactive —
 * fires the moment the user checks it off) and `useRecurringTaskCheck` (a
 * periodic scan that catches tasks completed while the app wasn't running,
 * e.g. across an overnight sleep). Both call this instead of duplicating
 * the spawn logic. `task` only needs to be completed and carry a
 * `recurrenceRule` — its `isCompleted`/`completedAt` fields aren't read
 * here, so a pre-toggle snapshot is fine.
 *
 * No-ops (creates nothing, touches no `lastRecurredDate`) unless BOTH gates
 * pass:
 *  - `shouldCreateRecurrence`: is the next occurrence due on/before today?
 *    Recurrence is a calendar concept ("every Monday"), not the app's
 *    day-start-adjusted concept of "today" — so `today` here is the local
 *    calendar date via `getLogicalDate(0)` (dayStartHour 0 never
 *    decrements the date), independent of the user's `dayStartHour`
 *    setting.
 *  - title dedup: is there already an incomplete task with the same title
 *    in the same project? A secondary guard against double-spawns (e.g.
 *    both triggers racing), kept even though the due-date gate above now
 *    does most of the work.
 *
 * On success, stamps `lastRecurredDate` on BOTH the new task and the
 * original — the original's stamp is what the next call's
 * `shouldCreateRecurrence` check reads.
 *
 * The spawned occurrence inherits the completed task's `timeBox` (a
 * recurring task keeps recurring into whichever box its owner is using it
 * from) with a fresh, unpinned `scheduledDate` and a `timeBoxOrder`
 * appended to that box.
